A high negative score (e.g., -90) means the response is terrible, cringe-worthy, or offensive and will likely end the conversation.
If you cannot understand the content of the response, you must return 0.
For any other case, you must return an integer between -100 and 100, but it cannot be 0.
Only return the integer grade and nothing else. Do not provide any explanation.
